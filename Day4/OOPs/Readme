  **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Dart is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects",  
  which can contain data (fields) and code (methods). Dart supports all OOP principles like class, object, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.  
  It helps in writing clean, modular, and reusable code.

  **Syntax (Basic Class & Object):**
    class Person {
      String name;
      int age;

      Person(this.name, this.age);

      void greet() {
        print('Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.');
      }
    }

    void main() {
      Person p1 = Person('Ram', 25);
      p1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Ram and I am 25 years old.
    }

  OOP makes code more manageable, especially for large applications.
