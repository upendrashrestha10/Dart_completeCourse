/**
   A for loop is used when you want to run a block of code a specific number of times. 
   It consists of an initializer, condition, and increment/decrement in a single line.

  ðŸ”¹ Syntax:
      for (initialization, condition, increment/decrement){
      ....
      .....
      }
      for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        // code to repeat
      }
  This example runs the loop 5 times, printing or processing something each time.

  For more information, you can see my detailed notes which is on README.md file.

void main(){
  for(int i = 0; i<=10; i++){
    print (i);
